title: Hello World

In this blog I will mainly write about my struggles computational biology. In my case that includes the analysis of **high-throughput sequencing** data, **phylogenetics** and **phylogenetic comparative methods**. 

I want to use this as a notebook for myself to be able to easily recall howto use different software or perform multi-step analyses. 

I will try to make all steps of different analyses as clear as possible so that this site may also serve as a reference for other people.
